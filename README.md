# ensemble-lvq
Ensemble lvq is based on the idea of transfer learning cum ensemble technique with lvq models.

# why?
The idea explores the possibility of harnessing transfer learning cum ensemble learning in lvq models. In this regard the max voting scheme is applied to achieve the classification results 

# How to use
To use ensemble-lvq, you must access learned prototypes from different models of lvq as transfered prototypes. So for a data set to be classified, apply the methods in hybrid.py script to obtian the predicated labels and the prediction probabilities as well as the votes which supports the outcomes.

# simulated results
Below is a simulated results of the technique with the iris data set.
