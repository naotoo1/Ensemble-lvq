ML package for both prototype and non-prototype-based classifiers that utilizes ensemble learning by soft and hard voting.

## why?
In ML the convention has been to save a trained model for future use or deployment. An alternative way in the case of prototype based models(learning vector quantization) would be to access learned prototypes from pre-trained models for use in deployment.

This project implements the harnessing of trained models and learned prototypes in ensemble learning for both prototype based ann non protype-based classification models. In this regard the hard voting and soft voting scheme is applied to achieve the classification results. 

## Installation
```python
pip install prosemble
```

## How to use
### Prototype-based example with LVQs
